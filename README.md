# Microservice-A
This microservice provides endpoints for simulating stat generation and dice rolling in a character creation or game mechanics context. It is designed to support:

- Initial stat value generation

- Selective re-rolling of a stat value

- Generic dice rolls for other systems (e.g., personality traits)
